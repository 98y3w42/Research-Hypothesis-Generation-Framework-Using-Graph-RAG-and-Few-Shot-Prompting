Synthetic hydrogels have been created using methods such as electro-spinning2, extrusion3, compositing4,5, freeze-casting6,7, self-assembly8 and mechanical stretching9,10 for improved mechanical performance. However, in contrast to tendons, many hydrogels with the same high water content do not show high strength, toughness or fatigue resistance. Here we present a strategy to produce a multi-length-scale hierarchical hydrogel architecture using a freezing-assisted salting-out treatment. The produced poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogels are highly anisotropic, comprising micrometre-scale honeycomb-like pore walls, which in turn comprise interconnected nanofibril meshes. These hydrogels have a water content of 70\u201395 per cent and properties that compare favourably to those of other tough hydrogels and even natural tendons; for example, an ultimate stress of 23.5 \u00b1 2.7 megapascals, strain levels of 2,900 \u00b1 450 per cent, toughness of 210 \u00b1 13 megajoules per cubic metre, fracture energy of 170 \u00b1 8 kilojoules per square metre and a fatigue threshold of 10.5 \u00b1 1.3 kilojoules per square metre. The presented strategy is generalizable to other polymers, and could expand the applicability of structural hydrogels to conditions involving more demanding mechanical loading.", "text": "Natural load-bearing materials such as tendons have a high water content of about 70 per cent but are still strong and tough, even when used for over one million cycles per year, owing to the hierarchical assembly of anisotropic structures across multiple length scales1.

{"id": 3, "question": "How can the thermoelectric performance of liquid-flow thermocells (LFTCs) for low-grade heat harvesting be enhanced by inducing hybrid entropy and restricting backward ionic movement in the electrolyte flow?", "entities": [70802, 20947], "answers": [{"kb_id": "Recent advancements in thermogalvanic batteries offer a promising route to efficient harvesting of low-grade heat with temperatures below 100 \u00b0C. The thermogalvanic temperature coefficient {\u0007lpha}, usually referred to as effective thermopower, is the key parameter determining the power density and efficiency of thermogalvanic batteries. However, the current understanding of improving {\u0007lpha} of redox pairs remains at the phenomenological level without microscopic insights, and the development of electrolytes with high {\u0007lpha} largely relies on experimental trial and error. This work applies the free energy perturbation method based on molecular dynamics simulations to predict the {\u0007lpha} of the {Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}} redox pair in aqueous and acetone solutions. We showed that {\u0007lpha} of the {Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}} redox pair can be increased from 1.5{\\pm}0.3 mV/K to 4.1{\\pm}0.4 mV/K with the increased acetone to water fraction. The predicted {\u0007lpha} of {Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}} both in pure water and acetone show excellent agreement with experimental values. By monitoring the fluctuation of dipole orientations in the first solvation shell, we discovered a significant change in the variance of solvent dipole orientation between Fe^{3+} and Fe^{2+}, which can be a microscopic indicator for large magnitudes of {\u0007lpha}. The effect of acetone weight fraction in the mixed acetone-water solvent on the {\u0007lpha} of {Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}} is also studied. Acetone molecules are found to intercalate into the first solvation shell of the {Fe^{2+}} ion at high acetone fractions, while this phenomenon is not observed in the solvation shell of the Fe^{3+} ion. Such solvation shell structure change of {Fe^{2+}} ions contributes to the enhanced {\u0007lpha} at high acetone fractions. Our discovery provides atomistic insights into how solvation shell order can be leveraged to develop electrolytes with high thermopower.", "text": "Recent advancements in thermogalvanic batteries offer a promising route to efficient harvesting of low-grade heat with temperatures below 100 \u00b0C. The thermogalvanic temperature coefficient {\u0007lpha}, usually referred to as effective thermopower, is the key parameter determining the power density and efficiency of thermogalvanic batteries. However, the current understanding of improving {\u0007lpha} of redox pairs remains at the phenomenological level without microscopic insights, and the development of electrolytes with high {\u0007lpha} largely relies on experimental trial and error. This work applies the free energy perturbation method based on molecular dynamics simulations to predict the {\u0007lpha} of the {Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}} redox pair in aqueous and acetone solutions. We showed that {\u0007lpha} of the {Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}} redox pair can be increased from 1.5{\\pm}0.3 mV/K to 4.1{\\pm}0.4 mV/K with the increased acetone to water fraction.

The scope of hydrogel applications, however, is often severely limited by their mechanical behaviour5. Most hydrogels do not exhibit high stretchability; for example, an alginate hydrogel ruptures when stretched to about 1.2 times its original length. Some synthetic elastic hydrogels6,7 have achieved stretches in the range 10\u201320, but these values are markedly reduced in samples containing notches. Most hydrogels are brittle, with fracture energies of about 10\u2009J\u2009m\u22122 (ref. 8), as compared with \u223c1,000\u2009J\u2009m\u22122 for cartilage9 and \u223c10,000\u2009J\u2009m\u22122 for natural rubbers10.

The density distribution of water near the GO sheets is different from the graphene surfaces due to the presence of hydrophilic functional groups of the GO sheets. Also, the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules are disturbed due to the presence of these groups on the GO surfaces. The results showed that as water molecules in areas which are close to the GO surfaces are isolated, and due to hydrogen bond formation between water molecules and the substituents of the GO, the water molecules have fewer hydrogen bonds with other water molecules around. In the middle region between two GO sheets, it has been seen that each water molecule is surrounded by more water molecules, and there are many more hydrogen bonds, so it is possible to consider a network structure of water in this region.

{"id": 8, "question": "How can the understanding of atomic site-specific reactivity on platinum (Pt) surfaces, particularly in relation to surface stress and its release, lead to improved design and efficiency of catalytic processes, such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)?", "entities": [20522, 30521, 36627], "answers": [{"kb_id": "Dynamic electrochemical surface stress response during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on Pt and Pd cantilever electrodes in HClO4 and KOH was examined to elucidate surface binding configurations during O2 reduction electrocatalysis. Upon reduction of O2, the surface of Pt exhibits a compressive surface stress response, \u0394Stress, in both acid and base electrolytes due to adsorption of the ORR reactant and intermediates (O2, O, and OH). The magnitude of compressive \u0394Stress on Pt is greater in acid relative to base. On the other hand, the surface of Pd exhibits a negligible \u0394Stress in acid and a slight compressive \u0394Stress in base. Thus, magnitudes of the compressive \u0394Stress (surface expansion) during the ORR follow the order of Pt (acid)\u202f>\u202fPt (base)\u202f>\u202fPd (base)\u202f>\u202fPd (acid)\u202f\u223c\u202f0. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of adsorbate-induced excess surface stress on Pt(111) and Pd(111) surfaces imply a greater compressive surface stress induced on Pt(111) for nearly all adsorbate geometries examined. This trend, which agrees with the experimental observations, can be correlated to a greater tensile intrinsic surface stress of Pt(111) relative to Pd(111) resulting from difference in bond strength and bulk modulus of two metals. On stepped Pt(221) and Pd(221) surfaces, both the intrinsic tensile stress of the clean surface and the adsorbate-induced excess compressive stress are significantly reduced due to the presence of less coordinated, flexible step sites. Moreover, this difference between surface stress at terrace and step sites is more pronounced on Pt, which exhibits a greater intrinsic surface stress.", "text": "Dynamic electrochemical surface stress response during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on Pt and Pd cantilever electrodes in HClO4 and KOH was examined to elucidate surface binding configurations during O2 reduction electrocatalysis. Upon reduction of O2, the surface of Pt exhibits a compressive surface stress response, \u0394Stress, in both acid and base electrolytes due to adsorption of the ORR reactant and intermediates (O2, O, and OH). The magnitude of compressive \u0394Stress on Pt is greater in acid relative to base. On the other hand, the surface of Pd exhibits a negligible \u0394Stress in acid and a slight compressive \u0394Stress in base. Thus, magnitudes of the compressive \u0394Stress (surface expansion) during the ORR follow the order of Pt (acid)\u202f>\u202fPt (base)\u202f>\u202fPd (base)\u202f>\u202fPd (acid)\u202f\u223c\u202f0.

Many anomalous properties of liquid water originate from its well-connected hydrogen bond network(1), including unusually efficient vibrational energy redistribution and relaxation(2). An accurate description of the ultrafast vibrational motion of water molecules is essential for understanding the nature of hydrogen bonds and many solution-phase chemical reactions. Most existing knowledge of vibrational relaxation in water is built upon ultrafast spectroscopy experiments(2-7). However, these experiments cannot directly resolve the motion of the atomic positions and require difficult translation of spectral dynamics into hydrogen bond dynamics. Here, we measure the ultrafast structural response to the excitation of the OH stretching vibration in liquid water with femtosecond temporal and atomic spatial resolution using liquid ultrafast electron scattering. We observed a transient hydrogen bond contraction of roughly 0.04 angstrom on a timescale of 80 femtoseconds, followed by a thermalization on a timescale of approximately 1 picosecond. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal the need to treat the distribution of the shared proton in the hydrogen bond quantum mechanically to capture the structural dynamics on femtosecond timescales. Our experiment and simulations unveil the intermolecular character of the water vibration preceding the relaxation of the OH stretch.

Most unfilled elastomers suffer from a poor mechanical strength, which limits their use. Using sacrificial bonds, we show how brittle, unfilled elastomers can be strongly reinforced in stiffness and toughness (up to 4 megapascals and 9 kilojoules per square meter) by introducing a variable proportion of isotropically prestretched chains that can break and dissipate energy before the material fails. Chemoluminescent cross-linking molecules, which emit light as they break, map in real time where and when many of these internal bonds break ahead of a propagating crack.

Increasing the weight ratio of oligomer in the resin system is an effective approach to enhance the mechanical properties, yet the viscosity of the UV-curable resin increases dramatically; this hinders its printing. In this study, a linear scan-based vat photopolymerization (LSVP) system which can print high-viscosity resins is implemented to 3D print the oligomer-dominated UV-curable resin via a dual-curing mechanism. A polyurethane methacrylate blocking oligomer is first synthesized and then mixed with a commercialized bifunctional oligomer, photoinitiator, and primary amine as a chain extender to prepare high-viscosity UV-curable resin for the LSVP system. The deblocked isocyanate is further crosslinked with a chain extender via thermal treatment to construct a highly entangled polymer chain network. The optimal thermal treatment parameters are investigated, and the resilience of the 3D-printed elastomer is evaluated through continuous tensile loading and unloading tests. Subsequently, complex structured elastomers are printed, exhibiting favorable mechanical durability without defects. The results obtained from this work will provide a reference for preparing elastomeric devices with excellent physical properties and expand the application scope of vat photopolymerization to new fields.", "text": "Elastomers prepared via vat photopolymerizationus ually exhibit unsatisfied mechanical properties owing to their insufficient growth of molecular weight upon UV exposure.

The approach aims to take advantage of the stochastic nature of the single-molecule regime to achieved lower limits of quantification (LOQ). Two emerging contaminants commonly found in aquatic environments, enrofloxacin (ENRO) and ciprofloxacin (CIPRO), were chosen as nonresonant molecular probes. The methodology involves a multivariate resolution curve fitting known as non-negative matrix factorization with alternating least-squares algorithm (NMF-ALS) to solve spectral overlaps. The key element of the quantification is to realize that, under SM-SERS conditions, the Raman intensity generated by a molecule adsorbed on a \u201chotspot\u201d can be digitalized. Therefore, the number of SERS event counts (rather than SERS intensities) was shown to be proportional to the solution concentration. This allowed the determination of both ENRO and CIPRO with high accuracy and precision even at ultralow concentrations regime. The LOQ for both ENRO and CIPRO were achieved at 2.8 pM.

Reduction of silver nitrate with hydroxylamine hydrochloride at alkaline pH and at room temperature yields highly sensitive SERS colloids within a short time.

Changing the mixing order and rate of the two involved solutions, silver nitrate and hydroxylamine hydrochloride containing sodium hydroxide, one can control the size and dispersion of the produced colloids. The obtained colloids have been characterized by UV\u2212vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and SERS using a 1064 nm laser line on a Fourier transform and a 785 nm laser line on a dispersive Raman spectrometer. The SERS enhancement factor of the hydroxylamine-reduced silver colloids was tested using crystal violet, rhodamine 6G, methylene blue, and 9-aminoacridine.

It was shown that electrochemicaloxidation of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) caused fracturing of the graphite lattice, thusincreasing edge plane density. This result is consistent with other reports from laser activation of HOPG,which correlate increased edge plane density with increased electron-transfer rate. Creation of edge planeis a phenomenon common to both oxidative and nonoxidative activation procedures and is responsiblefor HOPG activation.

This result is consistent with other reports from laser activation of HOPG,which correlate increased edge plane density with increased electron-transfer rate. Creation of edge planeis a phenomenon common to both oxidative and nonoxidative activation procedures and is responsiblefor HOPG activation. Arguments about the involvement of graphitic oxide or oxygen containing functionalgroups in electron-transfer activation are presented. After the present results are combined with thosefrom the literature, it appears unlikely that oxygen functional groups are involved in electron-transferactivation of several benchmark redox systems on carbon electrodes."}], "subgraph": {"tuples": [[62766, 11053, 6971], [35745, 13369, 52910], [35745, 5563, 2461], [35745, 8494, 63513], [62766, 8968, 48686], [35745, 10160, 57907], [23598, 5602,

Quantitative analysis reveals that the alkoxy-functionalized ammonium cation (N07+), bearing seven ether oxygen atoms, can effectively displace the bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anion (TFSI\u2212) from the Ca2+ ion coordination sphere, facilitating the reversible Ca deposition/stripping process.

Identification of PCET was an offshoot of experiments designed to investigate energy conversion by electron transfer quenching of molecular excited states. The concepts \u201credox potential leveling\u201d and concerted electron\u2013proton transfer came from measurements on stepwise oxidation of cis-RuII(bpy)2(py)(OH2)2+ to RuIV(bpy)2(py)(O)2+. The Ru \u201cblue dimer\u201d, cis,cis-(bpy)2(H2O)RuORu(OH2)(bpy)24+, was the first designed catalyst for water oxidation. It undergoes oxidative activation by PCET to give the transient (bpy)2(O)RuVORuV(O)(bpy)24+, O-atom attack on water to give a peroxidic intermediate, and further oxidation and O2 release. More recently, a class of single site water oxidation catalysts has been identified, e.g., Ru(tpy)(bpm)(OH2)2+ (tpy is 2,2\u2032:6\u2032,2\u2032\u2032-terpyridine; bpm is 2,2\u2032-bipyrimidine). They undergo stepwise PCET oxidation to RuIV=O2+ or RuV(O)3+ followed by O-atom transfer with formation of peroxidic intermediates which undergo further oxidation and O2 release. PCET plays a key role in the three zones of water oxidation reactivity: oxidative activation, O\u22efO bond formation, oxidation and O2 release from peroxidic intermediates. Similar schemes have been identified for electrocatalytic water oxidation on oxide electrode surfaces based on phosphonated derivatives such as [Ru(Mebimpy)(4,4\u2032-(PO3H2CH2)2bpy)(OH2)]2+. A PCET barrier to RuIII\u2013OH2+ \u2192 RuIV=O2+ oxidation arises from the large difference in pKa values between RuIII\u2013OH2+ and RuIV(OH)3+. On oxide surfaces this oxidation occurs by multiple pathways. Kinetic, mechanistic, and DFT results on single site catalysts reveal a new pathway for the O\u22efO bond forming step (Atom-Proton Transfer, APT), significant rate enhancements by added proton acceptor bases, and accelerated water oxidation in propylene carbonate as solvent with water added as a stoichiometric reagent. Lessons learned about water oxidation and the role of PCET and concerted pathways appear to have direct relevance for water oxidation in Photosystem II (PSII) with PSII a spectacular example of PCET in action.

To enable the circularity of FRPs, we formulated a bio-derivable polyester covalently adaptable network (PECAN), sometimes referred to as a polyester vitrimer, to manufacture FRPs at >1 kg scale, which is accomplished as the resin is infusible (175\u2013425 cP at 25\u00b0C viscosity), can be cured at 80\u00b0C within 5 h and is depolymerizable via methanolysis yielding high-quality fibers and recoverable hardener. The FRPs exhibit a transverse tensile modulus comparable with today\u2019s wind relevant FRPs (10.4\u201311.9 GPa). Modeling estimates a resin minimum selling price of $2.28/kg and, relative to an epoxy-amine resin, PECAN manufacture requires 19%\u201321% less supply chain energy and emits 33%\u201335% less greenhouse gas emissions.

Due attention was given to the interplay between the polymer and perovskite absorber, both within the framework of a bilayer structure and fully assembled solar cells. The obtained results imply that UV degradation exerts a major influence on the structural integrity of PTAA, rather than on the interface with the perovskite light harvester. Moreover, UV exposure induced more adverse effects on tested samples than environmental humidity and oxygen, contributing more to the overall reduction of charge extraction properties of PTAA, as well as increased defect population upon prolonged UV exposure.", "text": "Planar inverted lead halide photovoltaics demonstrate remarkable photoconversion properties when employing poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) as a hole transporting layer.

In this context, to improve the manufacturability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), we have developed a one-step solution-coating procedure in which the hole-selective contact and perovskite light absorber spontaneously form, resulting in efficient inverted PSCs. We observed that phosphonic or carboxylic acids, incorporated into perovskite precursor solutions, self-assemble on the indium tin oxide substrate during perovskite film processing. They form a robust self-assembled monolayer as an excellent hole-selective contact while the perovskite crystallizes. Our approach solves wettability issues and simplifies device fabrication, advancing the manufacturability of PSCs. Our PSC devices with positive\u2013intrinsic\u2013negative (p-i-n) geometry show a power conversion efficiency of 24.5% and retain >90% of their initial efficiency after 1,200\u2009h of operating at the maximum power point under continuous illumination. The approach shows good generality as it is compatible with different self-assembled monolayer molecular systems, perovskites, solvents and processing methods.", "text": "Simplifying the manufacturing processes of renewable energy technologies is crucial to lowering the barriers to commercialization.

The isosteric substitution of hydrogen by an electronegative fluorine atom has been proposed as a useful route to improve the photovoltaic performance of 2D OIPs, whereas its valuable role in developing ferroelectricity is still waiting for further exploration. Herein, for the first time we applied fluorinated aromatic cations in extending the family of 2D OIP ferroelectrics, and successfully obtained [2-fluorobenzylammonium]2PbCl4 as a high-performance ferroelectric semiconductor. The failures in the nonferroelectric [4-fluorobenzylammonium]2PbCl4 and [3-fluorobenzylammonium]2PbCl4 demonstrate that the selective introduction of fluorine in correct structural positions is particularly essential. This work represents an unprecedented proof-of-concept in the use of fluorinated aromatic cations for the targeted design of excellent 2D OIP ferroelectrics, and is believed to inspire the future development of low-cost, high-efficiency, and stable device applications.", "text": "Two-dimensional (2D) organic\u2013inorganic perovskites (OIPs), with improved material stability over their 3D counterparts, are highly desirable for device applications.

{"id": 29, "question": "How can we develop a scalable, sustainable material that provides efficient daytime radiative cooling by maximizing solar reflectance and minimizing unwanted solar absorption without relying on complex, non-eco-friendly production methods?", "entities": [61804, 10324], "answers": [{"kb_id": "Subambient daytime radiative cooling (SDRC) provides a promising electricity- and cryogen-free pathway for global energy-efficiency. However, current SDRC systems require stringent surface designs, which are neither cost-effective nor eco-friendly, to selectively emit thermal radiation to outer space and simultaneously maximize solar reflectance. Here, a generic method is developed to upgrade the conventional building-coating materials with a peculiar self-adaptive SDRC effect through combining particle scattering, sunlight-excited fluorescence, and mid-infrared broadband radiation. It is also theoretically proved that heat exchange with the sky can eliminate the use of resonant microstructures and noble metal mirrors in conventional SDRC, and also leads to enhanced daytime cooling yet suppressed nighttime overcooling. When exposed to direct sunlight, the upgraded coating over an aluminum plate can achieve 6 \u00b0C (7 \u00b0C on a scale-model building) below the ambient temperature under a solar intensity of 744 W m-2 (850 W m-2 ), yielding a cooling power of 84.2 W m-2 .

Thermally superinsulating aerogels are promising to isolate the heat for more energy-efficient cooling. However, most aerogels tend to absorb the sunlight for unwanted solar heat gain, and it is challenging to scale up the aerogel fabrication while maintaining consistent properties. Herein, we develop a thermally insulating, solar-reflective anisotropic cooling aerogel panel containing in-plane aligned pores with engineered pore walls using boron nitride nanosheets by an additive freeze-casting technique. The additive freeze-casting offers highly controllable and cumulative freezing dynamics for fabricating decimeter-scale aerogel panels with consistent in-plane pore alignments. The unique anisotropic thermo-optical properties of the nanosheets combined with in-plane pore channels enable the anisotropic cooling aerogel to deliver an ultralow out-of-plane thermal conductivity of 16.9\u2009mW\u2009m\u22121 K\u22121 and a high solar reflectance of 97%. The excellent dual functionalities allow the anisotropic cooling aerogel to minimize both parasitic and solar heat gains when used as cooling panels under direct sunlight, achieving an up to 7\u2009\u00b0C lower interior temperature than commercial silica aerogels.

This book covers an eclectic set of topics ranging from already classical systems, such as polyelectrolyte-modified electrodes (Chapter 2) and self-assembled monolayers of thiols on gold electrodes (Chapter 5), to relatively recent electrode systems based on nanomaterials. The latter include nanostructured electrodes (Chapter 1), electrodes based on carbon nanotubes (Chapter 3), and surface-attached electroactive nanoparticles (Chapter 4).

Known homogeneous CDA systems often require the use of sacrificial hydrogen acceptors (or oxidants), precious metal catalysts, and harsh reaction conditions, thus limiting most existing methods to dehydrogenation of non- or low-functionalized alkanes. Here we describe a visible-light-driven, dual-catalyst system consisting of inexpensive organophotoredox and base-metal catalysts for room-temperature, acceptorless-CDA (Al-CDA). Initiated by photoexited 2-chloroanthraquinone, the process involves H atom transfer (HAT) of aliphatics to form alkyl radicals, which then react with cobaloxime to produce olefins and H2. This operationally simple method enables direct dehydrogenation of readily available chemical feedstocks to diversely functionalized olefins. For example, we demonstrate, for the first time, the oxidant-free desaturation of thioethers and amides to alkenyl sulfides and enamides, respectively. Moreover, the system\u2019s exceptional site selectivity and functional group tolerance are illustrated by late-stage dehydrogenation and synthesis of 14 biologically relevant molecules and pharmaceutical ingredients. Mechanistic studies have revealed a dual HAT process and provided insights into the origin of reactivity and site selectivity.", "text": "The value of catalytic dehydrogenation of aliphatics (CDA) in organic synthesis has remained largely underexplored.

A variety of metal and main group halide reagents that have been used for the dichlorination or dibromination of alkenes are discussed, and the proposed mechanisms of these transformations are critically evaluated."}], "subgraph": {"tuples": [[70497, 2229, 64035], [4182, 7579, 9252], [53857, 4410, 52316], [3665, 2229, 60365], [17969, 3669, 5637], [48001, 3669, 42753], [52316, 4406, 27858], [70497, 2229, 17341], [43594, 2538, 65712], [51665, 12227, 42614], [42151, 7579, 42753], [3665, 2229, 17401], [70497, 2229, 1536], [65712, 8968, 34452], [70497, 2229, 5616], [57781, 9500, 19012], [52316, 4406, 36540], [52316, 12977, 32244], [52316, 7579, 52359], [72735, 10231, 42753], [56395, 7685, 31678], [5616, 7441, 5637], [17341, 12227, 28044], [15182, 7579, 45711], [5637, 10279, 65566], [57781, 4320, 38627], [64378, 5303, 56641], [4182, 3669, 20406], [70497, 2229, 42276], [6024, 11053, 49688], [19747, 1368, 24701], [6024, 9132, 56532], [70497, 2229, 501], [17969, 5004, 52316], [3665, 2229, 64378], [65495, 8890, 24122], [52316, 4406, 33819], [52316, 5632, 19747], [52316, 2176, 42311], [52316, 4406, 13072], [32244, 3530, 52316], [4182, 3820, 27819], [52316, 3042, 56072], [3665, 2229, 24122], [42524, 5563, 65137], [17723, 13947, 66251], [64378, 5004, 60477], [17723, 11188, 2439], [64378, 11437, 19140], [52316, 7579, 17969], [65712, 12373, 60365], [58474, 135, 27858], [501, 9944, 41108], [41108, 8251, 4182], [15182, 9102, 16626], [38627, 13166, 4182], [42524, 11974, 13348], [6024, 199, 1199], [19012, 6656, 58474], [6024, 8297, 10851], [3665, 2229, 32789], [72735, 9885, 42753], [52316, 933, 20320], [46390, 2026, 64035], [70497, 2229, 46390], [70497, 2229, 4182], [3665, 2229, 31330], [17723, 12294, 72735], [17723, 843, 43137], [14274, 7685, 31678], [52316, 3042, 60633], [3665, 2229, 43594], [3665, 2229, 52316], [50153, 3187, 53857], [501, 6795, 49509], [19012, 4854, 42753], [17723, 7685, 31330], [60477, 7895, 56641], [5616, 5627, 17341], [52316, 933, 14762], [70497, 2229, 62570], [70497, 2229, 47893], [46390, 2026, 1536], [3665, 2229, 65495], [6024, 1071, 33804], [42276, 7579, 9830], [70497, 2229, 15182], [17723, 4406, 48746], [57781, 9772, 38627], [50153, 13514, 11607], [17723, 10279, 42627], [3665, 2229, 56395], [70497, 2229, 55339], [3665, 2229, 50153], [52316, 8897, 67330], [6024, 7579, 56914], [17723, 12294, 24701], [3665, 2229, 14274], [47893, 11113, 42524], [70497, 2229, 56532], [62570, 6691, 51665], [52316, 6085, 58474], [3665, 2229, 17723], [4182, 5706, 38627], [17723, 10279, 41708], [42276, 695, 23654], [52316, 3530, 53758], [52316, 4406, 43719], [70497, 2229, 42614], [70497, 2229, 10241], [70497, 2229, 45708], [17723, 10279, 11289], [15182, 12387, 31554], [47893, 11113, 42276], [47893, 11113, 49124], [5616, 7441, 15182], [27699, 8297, 63909], [45708, 9132, 49124], [70497, 2229, 65297], [47893, 11113, 18229], [52316, 12109, 54305], [3665, 2229, 63909], [46390, 2026, 10241], [52316, 4203, 25512], [56914, 8049, 4182], [70497, 2229, 20406], [23848, 6185, 6024], [17401, 7579, 6024], [64378, 11437, 36705], [5616, 3669, 55339], [65297, 8159, 501], [52316, 4406, 1768], [17969, 5706, 4182], [70497, 2229, 41108], [52316, 8297, 42753], [52316, 2237, 69509], [52316, 3042, 13536], [42276, 695, 15872], [52316, 8297, 19012], [3665, 2229, 65712], [65495, 7579, 64378], [49124, 7579, 56574], [17723, 12294, 42151], [3665, 2229, 27699], [52316, 5001, 57781], [70497, 2229, 42524], [3665, 2229, 53857], [19012, 1023, 56914], [9049, 3669, 63909], [3665, 2229, 31678], [52316, 5001, 65617], [70497, 2229, 28044], [6024, 8297, 61761], [19747, 7323, 19012], [52316, 4406, 27709], [31678, 10462, 32789], [70497, 2229, 49124], [9830, 8239, 33804], [3665, 2229, 9049], [6024, 3108, 62316], [17723, 12294, 51671], [31330, 6185, 6024], [3665, 2229, 6024], [52316, 3042, 68602], [3665, 2229, 23848], [5637, 12419, 51149], [70497, 2229, 49509], [52316, 3996, 43034], [70497, 2229, 18229], [17723, 7685, 23848], [70497, 2229, 5637], [70497, 2229, 51665], [52316, 7441, 48001], [17723, 6774, 30375], [57781, 5546, 42151], [70497, 2229, 6024], [52316, 11926, 686], [52316, 4406, 45335]], "entities": [27819, 1536, 57781, 55339, 501, 60365, 5616, 6024, 17341, 58474, 47893, 56914, 42627, 49688, 42151, 24701, 34452, 23654, 54305, 56641, 56574, 27858, 17401, 13072, 42276, 2439, 38627, 66251, 36705, 31678, 43594, 20320, 50153, 23848, 9830, 67330, 32789, 41708, 15872, 3665, 51671, 68602, 65617, 52359, 17723, 46390, 56532, 64378, 4182, 65566, 43719, 10851, 45708, 53857, 14274, 63909, 686, 13348, 36540, 65137, 30375, 49124, 14762, 19140, 56395, 69509, 33804, 32244, 70497, 62570, 42311, 31554, 24122, 5637, 56072, 27699, 25512, 42524, 42614, 20406, 31330, 43034, 1199, 51149, 19012, 65297, 13536, 51665, 11607, 15182, 48746, 45335, 53758, 1768, 65495, 60633, 28044, 27709, 62316, 9252, 10241, 18229, 64035, 65712, 33819, 9049, 42753, 17969, 45711, 11289, 61761, 41108, 19747, 43137, 16626, 48001, 49509, 52316, 72735, 60477]}}

This strategy provides a practical, scalable and operationally straightforward method for the synthesis of C(sp2)\u2013C(sp3) bonds, and is compatible with challenging tertiary aliphatic halides, allowing for the preparation of 1,3-disubstituted target products."}], "subgraph": {"tuples": [[72694, 14164, 51003], [60126, 11100, 5063], [54735, 2723, 64868], [72694, 12731, 19438], [22922, 3669, 67617], [50899, 12920, 41317], [26483, 11958, 64868], [60126, 512, 8016], [72694, 9944, 34648], [72694, 728, 60439], [60126, 11100, 43203], [72694, 10701, 26483], [54100, 2229, 10867], [41854, 6835, 22639], [22922, 7099, 44254], [54100, 2229, 56307], [30199, 2751, 69567], [72694, 8159, 2700], [72694, 12060, 66273], [72694, 5724, 50851], [54735, 7270, 49377], [72694, 5627, 52316], [31655, 11201, 66334], [72694, 8159, 8618], [54100, 2229, 65253], [54735, 7579, 31515], [72694, 8536, 45653], [72694, 5004, 59377], [72694, 2015, 25121], [48579, 9547, 54735], [22922, 7099, 60439], [2993, 2229, 50142], [72694, 9944, 9661], [26834, 2256, 31655], [2993, 2229, 23484], [72694, 8890, 1761], [72694, 10217, 18594], [45568, 8890, 22879], [72694, 728, 28995], [72694, 13027, 68298], [72694, 12514, 2515], [2993, 2229, 72694], [54100, 2229, 24537], [67719, 2053, 62716], [72694, 4083, 55252], [22922, 3669, 22495], [60126, 12130, 52250], [72694, 7895, 12392], [16562, 13706, 14636], [54100, 2229, 48579], [22922, 10330, 25092], [54002, 7579, 34665], [2993, 2229, 26392], [15469, 5530, 45568], [72694, 11220, 41317], [54100, 2229, 44008], [72694, 5724, 43420], [45568, 21, 22495], [2993, 2229, 29818], [2993, 2229, 41854], [5780, 11958, 1725], [50142, 9624, 22639], [22922, 10279, 26392], [26483, 12236, 45817], [26834, 2256, 65253], [72694, 3930, 45817], [2993, 2229, 69567], [72694, 5004, 45477], [72694, 8159, 44429], [61275, 8049, 18817], [54735, 1533, 7775], [45568, 8297, 29818], [22922, 10330, 70506], [47306, 3669, 41317], [60126, 10625, 18970], [60439, 12770, 60439], [54735, 3669, 72368], [22922, 10095, 9089], [72694, 11125, 40663], [67719, 8297, 4372], [60126, 2651, 58895], [54100, 2229, 26834], [45568, 10831, 22639], [22922, 10330, 5780], [54735, 7355, 71780], [22922, 9635, 14742], [72694, 2015, 69286], [22922, 8297, 48413], [72694, 340, 29337], [48863, 10350, 26834], [72694, 11953, 58822], [72694, 5627, 46380], [29818, 129, 7969], [72694, 5004, 16505], [2993, 2229, 14636], [2993, 2229, 7969], [48579, 4582, 4372], [72694, 512, 20415], [72694, 2834, 5722], [54100, 2229, 54735], [60126, 2229, 46226], [11474, 11107, 53476], [2993, 2229, 67617], [2993, 2229, 22639], [4941, 11053, 49688], [72694, 8890, 48156], [2993, 2229, 61275], [72694, 12731, 8240], [45568, 21, 23484], [54735, 8297, 71312], [7775, 13696, 26483], [54100, 2229, 9631], [54735, 2439, 35727], [72694, 10330, 50899], [22922, 13312, 41013], [60126, 6656, 56307], [72694, 2015, 34665], [60126, 512, 69054], [16562, 1330, 23484], [4941, 5530, 45568], [54100, 2229, 52250], [22922, 5627, 17889], [22922, 5013, 52342], [72694, 5129, 54184], [2993, 2229, 22879], [45568, 8159, 56092], [2993, 2229, 4941], [2993, 2229, 16562], [2993, 2229, 18817], [22922, 10095, 25566], [72694, 3669, 53476], [2993, 2229, 22495], [2993, 2229, 47904], [69286, 7579, 25121], [54100, 2229, 46226], [2993, 2229, 22922], [50899, 8831, 52316], [72694, 1761, 7084], [24537, 10350, 26834], [60126, 2229, 10867], [2993, 2229, 62440], [2993, 2229, 56092], [72694, 12514, 15734], [2993, 2229, 15469], [72694, 2015, 11474], [2993, 2229, 30199], [56307, 12989, 13232], [22922, 10330, 1725], [62440, 6085, 61275], [54100, 2229, 6399], [54735, 501, 65371], [56307, 2386, 67173], [26392, 684, 6778], [26392, 8677, 47306], [72694, 2015, 54002], [9631, 11100, 48863], [54100, 2229, 60126], [24537, 10350, 44008], [72694, 9944, 18817], [54100, 2229, 48863], [54100, 2229, 4372], [72694, 13814, 44579], [54100, 2229, 67719], [2993, 2229, 45568], [60126, 11100, 11474], [54100, 2229, 62716], [41317, 10039, 52316], [54100, 2229, 31655], [60126, 2651, 6399]], "entities": [9661, 62440, 71780, 69054, 54100, 25121, 5780, 68298, 8618, 26834, 55252, 47306, 67173, 49688, 66334, 58895, 52250, 67617, 7969, 54735, 46226, 8240, 59377, 49377, 35727, 67719, 9089, 44429, 5722, 15469, 52342, 56092, 25566, 14742, 18594, 46380, 45477, 20415, 14636, 50142, 43203, 40663, 31515, 70506, 22495, 10867, 54002, 54184, 41317, 16505, 11474, 34665, 29337, 22639, 62716, 22922, 2700, 45568, 72694, 9631, 60126, 48413, 48863, 28995, 69567, 64868, 43420, 18817, 12392, 1761, 16562, 66273, 18970, 71312, 48579, 29818, 1725, 69286, 53476, 15734, 41013, 7775, 30199, 65253, 50899, 58822, 26483, 31655, 23484, 45817, 7084, 2993, 4372, 17889, 48156, 56307, 51003, 72368, 24537, 5063, 13232, 22879, 65371, 6778, 50851, 25092, 6399, 2515, 47904, 60439, 34648, 44008, 8016, 61275, 45653, 19438, 26392, 41854, 4941, 44579, 44254, 52316]}}

Here we report the development of a nickel-catalysed protocol that enables selective homo- and cross-dimerization of unactivated linear and sterically congested terminal alkenes to afford linear alkyl\u2012alkyl products in good yields and high linear/branched selectivity. The process is tolerant of a range of functionalities including heteroatoms, saturated heterocycles and bioactive motifs. Mechanistic experiments reveal that the co-oxidants we used, CuBr2 and di-tert-butyl peroxide, probably convert dialkyl\u2012Ni(II) intermediates to the corresponding Ni(III) species through a single-electron-transfer process. This oxidative step avoids decomposition of thermally labile dialkyl\u2012Ni(II) intermediates and promotes the formation of hydrodimerization products by reductive elimination of the Ni(III) complex. Without CuBr2, high branched selectivity was achieved, affording the methyl-branched products\u2014which are typically difficult to synthesize\u2014in good yields."}], "subgraph": {"tuples": [[9830,
